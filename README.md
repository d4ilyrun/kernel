# Kernel

This is a mere hobby kernel for 32-bit x86, to learn about OS/Kernel development.

I'm learning from [osdev](www.osdev.org), following a roadmap from my school's [kernel project](https://k.lse.epita.fr/getting_started/dependencies.html).

## Dependencies

* GNU Make
* QEMU

## Building

```bash
$ make      # builds the kernel.iso file
$ make qemu # boots up qemu using the iso file
```

## Testing

I don't know how I can test kernel code, so all tests are performed manually for the time being ...
