 * # Libpath
 *
 * ## Description
 *
 * This library allows us to parse and walk along a path (backward and forward).
 * It does so by splitting a path into different \c segments, around the '/'
 * separator. Once a segment has been parsed, you can retrieve the previous and
 * next ones, thus effectively walking along the original path
 * (see \ref libpath_walk for more details).
 *
 * @note This library does **not** create a path nor modify the original string,
 * and simply uses a safer simple string wrapper as well as substrings to find
 * its way around the original raw string.
