 * @brief Scheduler implementation

 *
 * # Scheduler
 *
 * The scheduler is responsible for ... well, scheduling proceses.
 *
 * It has to decide which threads to run next, and when, among all
 * currently running threads. This is what allows running multiple threads
 * on a single CPU.
 *
 * A good scheduler is crucial to the user's experience, and this is often what
 * makes the "feel" of the entire OS.
 *
 * ## Design
 *
 * For now, our scheduler uses a preemptive round-robin design.
 * It holds a list of currently running threads, called the runqueue,
 * and cycles between them at a regular interval.
 *
 * The interval is set currently set to 2MS, per thread, per cycle, and is
 * handled inside \ref irq_timer_handler. If the current thread is still
 * running when the current interval reaches its end, the next one takes its
 * place, and the timer is reset. This is called preemption.
 *
 * During the execution of a thread, it often needs to access some
 * resources, thus having to wait until the resource is available. When this is
 * the case, the thread is marked as \ref SCHED_WAITING using \ref
 * sched_block_current_thread, and we switch to the next available running
 * thread. Once the resource is available, the relevant interface has the
 * resposibility to notify the scheduler that the thread can be rescheduled,
 * using \ref sched_unblock_thread.
 *
 * ## Improvements
 *
 * * Use a separate timer for pre-emption, instead of mingling with the one used
 *   for timekeeping. This would allow for dynamically resetting the timer
 *   interrupt without sacrificing precision on ticks.
 *
 * * Priority levels. We would like to give more time to more "important"
 *   thread ideally. This would require multiple runqueues, but is a MUST
 *   have for any actual scheduler.
 *
 * * SMP: when activating multiprocessing, we want to setup a scheduler per
 *   core, and dispatch threads across them. This would also imply other smart
 *   opimizations (time stealing, ...)
 *
 * @{
