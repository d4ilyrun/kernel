 * # VMM
 *
 * ## Description
 *
 * The virtual memory manager is responsible for handling the available virtual
 * addresses.
 *
 * It has to keep track of which virtual addresses have already been allocated,
 * as well as per-region flags and parameters (file-mapped, kernel, mmio, ...).
 * This is done per-process, each one having their own VMM.
 *
 * This should be dinstinguished from the PMM and MMU. All three work
 * **together**, but serve their own respective purpose. Please refer to the
 * corresponding header and code for information about those.
 *
 * ## Implementation
 *
 * The virtual memory allocator keeps track not of singular addresses, but of
 * Virtual Memory Areas (VMAs).
 *
 * We store these areas inside an AVL tree, as it allows for faster lookup
 * operations. We use two different trees to store these, one ordered by the
 * size of the area, the other ordered by its address. The areas inside both
 * trees are the same, we chose between them depending on the type of operation
 * we need to perform.
 *
 * For allocating the structs which constitute these trees, we reserve a 32kiB
 * area within the current virtual space which will be used only to address
 * our underlying structs.
 *
 * @note This is only the first design. The way we handle memory regions will
 * surely change in the future as I learn more and more features are implemented
 * in the kernel. Here's a exhaustive list of things that are subject to change:
 * * Should we keep using 2 trees: twice as long to modify, but lookup is faster
 * * One region per allocation? Can't it grow too big?
 * * Keep a track of the pageframes inside the regions will become necessary
 * * Getting rid of the bitmap inside the VMM struct (how?)

/**
 * @brief Virtual Memory Area
 *
 * @struct vma
 *
 * A virtual memory area represents a contiguous area in the virtual address
 * space. A single area can be allocated (currently in use), or not. If an area
 * is marked as 'free', this means that each (virtual) addresses located inside
 * it can safely be given to a function which requests it.
 *
 * Each area can also be associated with different feature flags (defined as
 * VMM_F_*). This is necessary to be able distinct between addresses mapped to
 * files or not, or even addresses mapped to IO devices.
 *
 * VMAs are managed by the Virtual Memory Manager, and should not be interacted
 * with directly by the user. They serve as an internal structure for the VMM to
 * be able to easily keep track of allocated addresses.
 *
 * @link avl_t Internal data, used to go through the VMM's AVL tree.

 * @struct vmm

 * @brief Virtual Memory Manager
 *
 * A VMM is responsible for managing the allocated virtual addresses within a
 * process.
 *
 * The VMM splits the address space into distinct regions called Virtual Memory
 * Areas, and keeps track of them individually using AVL trees.
 *
 * A VMM does not necessarily manage the full 32bits address space, instead it
 * is assigned a start and end addresses, and only keeps track of the regions
 * inside this range.
 *
 * The VMM uses two different AVL trees to keep track of the VMAs:
 *  *   Ordered by address to easily retrieve the area to which an address
 *      belongs.
 *  *   Ordered by size to retrieve the first fitting area when allocating
 *
 * @note The tree ordered by size does not keep track of used areas, since we
 * never need to search for un-free area by size. This avoid modifying the
 * trees more than we need to, since it can be costly.
