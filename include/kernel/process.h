/**
 * @brief Process management
 * @file kernel/process.h
 *
 * This file defines the data structures and functions for managing processes
 * and threads in a multithreading model.
 *
 * A process is an instance of a program that is being executed by one or more
 * threads. Each process has its own unique address space, which means that it
 * has its own virtual memory space that is separate from other processes. This
 * allows each process to have its own private memory space, which is not
 * accessible to other processes. A process also has its own set of system
 * resources, such as open files descriptors.
 *
 * A thread is an execution context that is created within a process.
 * Threads within the same process share the same address space. They do not
 * share the same execution context (registers, stack).
 *
 * Both processes and threads are identified using a unique id: PID and TID.
 * Threads do not exist without a containing process, and processes are forced
 * to always contain at least one alive thread.
 *
 * The file provides functions for creating and killing processes, creating and
 * killing threads, as well as switching between them.
