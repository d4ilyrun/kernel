/**
 * @brief Virtual Memory System - Address Space
 *
 * # Address space
 *
 * Each process has an associated address space that defines the mapping between
 * An address space is composed of one or more memory segments, each managing a
 * contiguous region of virtual memory with common properties (such as backing
 * storage, protections, and fault handling).
 *
 * The address space API abstracts away the complexities of:
 * - Virtual-to-physical memory translation
 * - Page fault management
 * - Protection and permission settings
 *
 * This design is greatly inspired by that of SunOs (see docs/address_space.pdf)
 *
 * ## Considerations
 *
 * This API can only manage page-aligned addresses (and sizes). If you need to
 * align buffers smaller than a page, please use the @ref kmalloc API instead.
 * Note that the @ref kmalloc API always rounds up the requested size to a power
 * of two, so any allocation larger than a size could theoretically be done
 * using the VM API instead (but you'd have to manually align the buffer's size
 * to be page-aligned).
 *
